      Zod is a powerful TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library that we use to define our ATT&CK Data Model.
      By utilizing Zod, we ensure that our data structures are robust, consistent, and easy to maintain.
      The schemas allow us to generate documentation, providing clear and concise information for developers and ATT&CK users.
      This approach not only streamlines our development process but also enhances the reliability of our data model.
      With Zod, we can easily adapt to changes and ensure that our data model remains accurate and up-to-date.

      This site leverages Zod schemas to automatically generate comprehensive documentation, ensuring it is always in sync with the underlying data model.
      By minimizing documentation discrepancies previously prone to human error, this approach ensures our documentation remains accessible and user-friendly.
      Beyond documentation, the ATT&CK Data Model allows users to parse, validate, and utilize the data in the ATT&CK knowledge base as a TypeScript object.
      Integrating Zod ensures data handling is efficient and reliable, enhancing the accuracy and usability of our data to support developers in their work.

      Currently, the ATT&CK knowledge base does not fully conform to the defined Zod schemas, and there are known discrepancies that need to be addressed.
      We are actively working on aligning our data with the schemas to ensure complete compliance.
      This process involves identifying and rectifying inconsistencies to enhance the accuracy and reliability of our data.
